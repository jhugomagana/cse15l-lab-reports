# Lab Report 2 – Week 4
## Incremental Programming and Debugging +
### Best Practices in version control and committing individual bug fixes
> **Lab overview and tasks:**
# ヽ༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽ﾉ
>>In this blog post, we will cover how to use sample **Failure-inducing input** *(..(⚆ᗝ⚆)..inducing)* and how to cope ಥ_ಥ with debugging. I'm joking, even so - it is totally normal to get frustrated with debugging from time to time. A good thing you will likely pick up from this course is the sense that *attitude* weighs **heavy** when it comes to debugging *else* run the risk of breaking more code **-and-** to learn to start small (incremental programming) to start smart :) 
>>Check this [article](https://jvns.ca/blog/debugging-attitude-matters/) provided in lab for example:

>> Laying it all on the table 
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ) ... there are more approachable ways to debugging and there are other common but misconceived approaches to avoid. Refer to END of the page for more resources provided through the course :)

### Getting Started
Before we can begin, you might want to have this [starter code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse) in hand - will make it easier to follow along.
To get a quick idea of what this ```Markdown Parser``` is supposed to do, check out the short clip below:
<video src="assets\images\week4.intro.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 1000px;"></video>
As of now, it can read a simple.md file as a parameter and will attempt to retrieve all the links found in the given file. However - as we progress through the labs, we will need to evolve the code to handle **any** or **all** markdown files, and return only the links and nothing else in said file.
> Starting from this point, we will learn the approach of *incremental programming* and proactive *debugging* - as we assess the expectations of the program, starting with **Failure-inducing inputs**. In this case, these will be 3 simple yet unique test.md files that categorize, as well as reveal individual symptoms. Hopefully this systematic approach will help us understand and address any faulty logic in our code as we build it up. 
>> (bugs = logic errors in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly[symptoms], but not to terminate abnormally/crash it) 
**déjà vu** Σ(-᷅_-᷄๑) *did i just create link above*
