# Lab Report 2 – Week 4
## Incremental Programming and Debugging +
### Best Practices in version control and committing individual bug fixes
> **Lab overview and tasks:**
# ヽ༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽ﾉ
>>In this blog post, we will cover how to use sample **Failure-inducing input** *(..(⚆ᗝ⚆)..inducing tears)* and how to cope ಥ_ಥ with debugging. I'm joking, but even so - it is totally common to get frustrated with debugging from time to time. A good thing you will likely pick up from this course is the sense that *attitude* weighs **heavy** when it comes to debugging *else* you run the risk of breaking your code further **-and-** to learn to start small (incremental programming) so you can start smart :) 
>>Check this [article](https://jvns.ca/blog/debugging-attitude-matters/) provided in lab for example:

>> Laying it all on the table 
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ) ... we see there are more approachable ways to debugging and moreover there are the typical yet misconceived approaches to avoid. Refer to the END of the page for more debug reads provided in the course :)

### Getting Started
Before we can begin, you might want to have this [starter code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse) in hand - it will be easier to follow along with the clips as you pause and try getting some outout of your own :)
To get a quick idea of what this ```Markdown Parser``` is supposed to do, check out the short clip below:
<video src="assets\images\week4.intro.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 1000px;"></video>
As of now, the program can read-in a simple.md file as a parameter and will attempt to retrieve all the links found in the given file. **HOWEVER** - as we progress through the labs, we will need to evolve the code to handle **any** or **all** markdown files, and return only the links and nothing else from the give file(s).
> Moving on, we will learn the approach of *incremental programming* and proactive *debugging* - by assessing the expectations of the program, starting with **Failure-inducing inputs**. In this case, these will be 3 simple, yet unique test.md files that categorize, as well as reveal individual **symptoms**. Hopefully this systematic approach will help us understand and address any *faulty logic* in our code as we build-UP. 
>> (**bugs** = *logic errors* in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly[**symptoms**], but does not terminate abnormally or crash) 
**déjà vu** Σ(-᷅_-᷄๑) *did i just create a link above*

For more reference - link over to this vid from Joe as he walks us through the creation of this program. Hopefully this will give you better intuition of the starter code's base logic and methods
