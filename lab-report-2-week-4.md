# Lab Report 2 – Week 4
## Incremental Programming and Debugging
### + Best Practices in version control and committing individual bug fixes
> **Lab overview and tasks:**
# ヽ༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽ﾉ
>>In this blog post, we will cover how to use sample **Failure-inducing input** *( ...inducing say-what ?)* while learning to cope ಥ_ಥ with debugging. I joke, but you know what - it's totally normal to get frustrated with debugging from time to time. A good thing you will pick up from this class is why *attitude* weighs **heavy** when debugging to not break more code -and- if you learn to start small (incrementally) you start smart :) 
>>Check this [article](https://jvns.ca/blog/debugging-attitude-matters/) provided in lab for example:

>> Laying it all in the table ┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ) ... one can see better ways of debugging and the things avoid. Refer to more resources from lab at the END of the page :)

### Getting Started
Before we can begin, you might want to have the [starter code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse) provided by Joe in hand - makes it easier to follow along.
Below is a quick recap of what the starter code is supposed to achieve

For more reference - link over to this vid to see the code as it's being typed out and get a better intuition of the starter code's base logic.
