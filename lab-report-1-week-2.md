# Lab Report 1 – Week 2
## Remote Access into the `ieng6` Server
> **Lab overview and tasks:**
>> In this blog, we will cover how to set our computer up for remote access into the **CSE Dungeon** computers. If you're in this *class*, or likey any other ***CSE course***, we will need to find your *<mark>CSE course-specific account</mark>* in order to **`ssh`** from your local computer into the **`ieng6`** server holding the account. There are many ways to accomplish this connection, but for now we will use **Visual Studio Code's** remote option, via the IDE's integrated terminal. Following a successful connection, we will test out a few **Unix-like commands** and familiarize with the ***Linux Filesystem***. One command in particular, **`scp`**, will come in handy to transfer files over <mark>SSH</mark>. Lastly, we will generate our own unique *<mark>SSH Keys</mark>* and further ***optimize remote running*** over the command line :)

### Installing VScode
First, we need to head over to the Visual Studio Code website https://code.visualstudio.com/, and follow the instructions there to download the appropriate version for our OS and install it onto our computer. When it is installed, we should be able to open a window that looks like this (depending on our system/settings, it may reflect different colors or menu bar):
