# Lab Report 1 – Week 2

## Remote Access into the `ieng6` Server
> **Lab overview and tasks**
>> In this blog, we will cover how to set our computer up for remote access into the CSE *Dungeon* computers. If you're in this class, or likey any other ==CSE== course, we will need to find your ==CSE course-specific account== in order to `ssh` from your local computer to the `ieng6` server holding the account. There are many ways to accomplish this connection, but for now we will use Visual Studio Code's remote option via the IDE's integrated terminal. Following a successful connection, we will test out a few Unix-like commands and familiarize with the Linux Filesystem. One command in particular, `scp`, will come in handy to transfer files over ==SSH==. Lastly, we will generate our own unique ==SSH Keys== and further optimize remote running over the command line :)
