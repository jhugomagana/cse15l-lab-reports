# Lab Report 5 – Week 10
## Sample markdown snippets and further testind:

> **Lab overview and tasks:**
>>For this lab report, we will choose any two tests from the 652 commonmark-spec tests. The two tests with different will correspond to different bugs. Next we will explain how to find the tests with different results 
** (Did you use diff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)
>>For each test:
** We'll describe which implementation is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
** For the implementation that’s not correct, we'll describe the bug (the problem in the code) - and show the code that should be fixed.
